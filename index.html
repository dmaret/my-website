        <h1>Hi, this is my new website!</h1>
        <p id="intro">I recently decided to start my journey in <strong>UX design</strong>
            and I thought it would be a great idea to make my own blog from scratch,
            where I can record my progress. <em>I am so excited!</em>

        <!--This is opening link in same tab. This is a relative link.-->
        <p>
            Click <a href="aboutme.html">here</a> to read more about me.
        </p>

        <!--This is how we open in new tab, using target, and removing/unlinking
        the main page and sub page.-->
        <p>
            Click <a href="aboutme.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> to read about me in another tab.
        </p>

        <!--This is an absolute link.-->
        <p>
            This is where I learned to make this website:
            <a href="https://theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>
        </p>

        <h3>See my projects <a href="./myprojects/myprojects.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</h3>
        <!--Inline styles have higher precedence than internal/external styles.
        Note the difference between inline and internal styles.-->
